This is a solid chili I landed on after trying many. It will fill 2/3 of a Crock Pot, so plenty to go around.

**Ingredients**

* 3 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoon sugar
* 2 tablespoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 1/2 cup almond or coconut milk*
* 6 tablespoon canola oil
* 2 egg
* 2 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions**

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.
2. Add milk, canola oil, egg and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth.
3. Preheat a non-stick griddle or large skillet to medium heat. (Coat pan with butter or oil if not using non-stick).
4. Pour about â…“ cup batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Allow it to cook until bubbles are visible throughout the pancake before flipping.
5. Repeat until all batter has been used.
