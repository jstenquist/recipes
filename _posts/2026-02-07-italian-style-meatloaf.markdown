A meatloaf that slices perfectly, stays juicy, and transforms into incredible sandwiches the next day. The secret is a proper panade (bread + milk + egg), cooked aromatics, and shaping into a tight cylinder before baking. Think Italian meatball flavors in meatloaf form.

Serves 4-6

## Ingredients

### Meatloaf
- 1 lb ground beef
- ½–1 lb ground pork
- 3 slices crustless white bread
- ½ cup whole milk
- 1 egg
- 1 small onion, fine dice
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 2–3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- ½ cup tomato sauce (plus more for glazing)
- Handful of fresh basil, chopped
- Pinch dried oregano
- Salt
- Fresh black pepper

### Glaze
- Extra tomato sauce
- Butter
- Honey

## Instructions

1. **Make the panade:** Mash bread, milk, and egg into a paste. Let it fully hydrate for 5–10 minutes.

2. **Cook aromatics:** Sweat onion in olive oil with a pinch of salt until soft and slightly sweet. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds. Set aside to cool slightly.

3. **Build the base:** Into the panade, mix the cooled onion and garlic, basil, oregano, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Make it uniform.

4. **Combine meat:** Fold in beef and pork gently. Don't knead like dough—mix until just combined. Let sit 10–15 minutes so the bread absorbs and proteins relax.

5. **Shape the loaf:** Lay out two long sheets of plastic wrap. Form the meat into a log and roll it tight, like a giant sausage. Twist the ends to compress. Wrap the whole thing in foil.

6. **Bake:** Place on a sheet pan and bake at 350°F until the center hits 155°F. Rest it—carryover will finish the job.

7. **Make the glaze:** Warm extra tomato sauce with butter and a touch of honey.

8. **Glaze and finish:** Unwrap the loaf. Place on a rack over a sheet pan. Brush generously with glaze. Return to oven until sticky, shiny, and browned.

9. **Serve:** Slice thick. More sauce if you want.

## Notes

**Why a panade matters:** Breadcrumbs are dry and pull moisture out of meat as it cooks. A panade is already hydrated—it becomes a paste that traps juices and emulsifies with the fat. The difference between compacted ground meat and something plush and sliceable.

**Why cook the onions:** Raw onion = sharp, watery, inconsistent. Cooked onion = sweet, integrated, professional.

**Next-day upgrade:** Chill the whole loaf. Slice cold (it'll be perfect). Sear in butter until crusty, then cover to steam through. Hero sandwich. Slider party. Lunch solved.

**Restaurant-style serving:** Stand a slice upright, add sauce, melt mozzarella or provolone over the top.
