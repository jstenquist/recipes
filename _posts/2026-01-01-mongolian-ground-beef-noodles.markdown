## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup beef broth
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional for a spicy kick)
- 10 oz linguine
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- 4 green onions, sliced for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Cook the Pasta:** Cook the linguine according to the package instructions in a large pot of boiling water. Drain and set aside.

2. **Brown the Ground Beef:** In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef until no longer pink. Drain any excess fat.

3. **Add Aromatics and Sauces:** Add minced garlic to the skillet with the beef and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in soy sauce, beef broth, brown sugar, hoisin sauce, ground ginger, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir well to combine.

4. **Thicken the Sauce:** In a small bowl, mix cornstarch with cold water until smooth. Stir this mixture into the skillet with the beef and sauce. Allow to simmer gently until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.

5. **Combine with Noodles:** Add the cooked linguine to the skillet with the beef and sauce. Toss together until the noodles are fully coated with the sauce. Let them simmer together for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.

6. **Serve:** Garnish with sliced green onions and serve immediately.
