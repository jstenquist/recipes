Soft, sturdy, naturally fermented hot dog buns made with 100% sourdough starter. They toast up beautifully and hold up to all your favorite toppings. Makes 10 buns.

**Tools**

* Stand mixer with dough hook (or knead by hand)
* Hot dog bun pan (optional — a parchment-lined baking sheet works fine)

**Ingredients**

*Levain:*
* 10 grams ripe/active sourdough starter (about 2 teaspoons)
* 100 grams all purpose or bread flour (about 3/4 cup)
* 100 grams water (about 7 tablespoons)

*Dough:*
* 200 grams levain, ripe, bubbly and active (heaping 3/4 cup)
* 240 grams milk, 2% or whole (about 1 cup)
* 1 large egg (about 50 grams)
* 40 grams honey (about 2 tablespoons)
* 10 grams salt (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)
* 55 grams unsalted butter, melted (about 4 tablespoons)
* 550 grams bread flour (about 4 cups)

*Egg Wash:*
* 1 large egg
* Splash of water (about 1 teaspoon)

**Instructions**

1. **Mix levain.** Combine 10 grams ripe sourdough starter with 100 grams flour and 100 grams water. Cover and let rise overnight (~12 hours) until doubled, bubbly, and peaked. (Or substitute 200 grams of ripe, active starter.)
2. **Mix dough.** In a stand mixer with dough hook, combine levain, milk, egg, honey, salt, melted butter, and most of the bread flour. Mix until combined, adding remaining flour gradually until dough is tacky and pulls away from the bowl. Knead 5-7 minutes until smooth. (By hand: knead 10-12 minutes.)
3. **Bulk ferment.** Place dough in a container in a warm spot (78°F) for 4-5 hours until puffed ~30% and smooth/airy. (Optional: refrigerate overnight up to 48 hours after bulk fermentation.)
4. **Shape.** Turn dough out and divide into 10 pieces (~110 grams each). Pat each into a 2×4-inch rectangle, roll tightly into a 6-inch log, and pinch the seam. Place in hot dog pan or on parchment-lined baking sheet.
5. **Proof.** Cover and let rise 3-4 hours at 78-80°F until doubled, puffed, and light. Dough should leave a small indentation when pressed, springing back slightly.
6. **Preheat oven** to 400°F. Place a baking stone or sheet on the bottom rack to prevent burning. (If oven runs hot, use 375°F.)
7. **Egg wash.** Mix egg with a splash of water and brush on top of buns.
8. **Bake** 20-25 minutes until golden and internal temperature reaches 190-195°F. Rest 5 minutes in pan, then cool on a wire rack.

**Notes**

Can be shaped into hamburger buns instead — follow shaping from a hamburger bun recipe. Freezes well after baking.
