A beef bourguignon-inspired pot roast with a rich red wine sauce, bacon, mushrooms, and vegetables all cooked together. Fancy but not fussy.

**Ingredients**

* 4 ounces thick-cut bacon (2½ to 3 slices), cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces
* 1 (about 3-pound) boneless beef chuck roast
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed
* ¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced (about 1½ cups)
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms (whole)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme, or 3 sprigs fresh thyme
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1½ cups low-sodium beef broth
* 1 (750-ml) bottle dry red wine (like Cabernet Sauvignon)
* 12 ounces carrots or parsnips (3 medium), cut into 2-inch pieces
* 1 pound baby yellow, Yukon Gold, or red potatoes (1½ to 2 inches wide)
* Chopped fresh thyme or parsley leaves, for garnish (optional)

**Instructions**

1. Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 350°F.

2. Place bacon in a 5-quart or larger Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to a large plate with a slotted spoon, leaving fat in pot.

3. Trim any excess surface fat from the chuck roast and pat dry. Season all over with salt and ½ teaspoon pepper.

4. Sear the roast in the bacon fat until well-browned on 2 sides, 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate with the bacon.

5. Add onion and mushrooms to the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up browned bits, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes.

6. Stir in garlic, tomato paste, thyme, and remaining ¼ teaspoon pepper. Cook until tomato paste darkens, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with flour, stir to coat, and cook for 1 minute.

7. Stir in beef broth, scraping up any browned bits. Add wine and bacon. Return roast and any accumulated juices to pot. Bring to a simmer.

8. Cover and transfer to oven. Cook for 2 hours.

9. Uncover and flip the roast. Scatter potatoes around the roast, making sure they're submerged. Scatter carrots around, mostly submerged. Return to oven uncovered until roast is very tender and a knife slides easily into the center, 1 to 1½ hours more.

10. Taste sauce and season with salt as needed. Shred roast in pot with tongs, or transfer to cutting board and slice across the grain. Serve with vegetables and sauce, garnished with fresh thyme if desired.

**Notes**

* Make ahead: Can be made 1 day in advance. Cool completely, cover, refrigerate. Reheat covered on stovetop or in 325°F oven.
* Storage: Refrigerate up to 4 days, or freeze up to 3 months.
* Can use white button mushrooms or wild mushrooms instead of cremini.
* Larger potatoes work too — just cut into 2-inch chunks first.

Serves 4-6. Prep 30 minutes. Cook 3½ to 4 hours.
