Tender chuck roast in a deeply-flavored and smoky sauce — the ultimate beef chili. Best made on a weekend with time to simmer.

**Tools**

* Large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot

**Ingredients**

* ¼ cup ground ancho chile pepper
* 1 tablespoon ground chipotle chile pepper
* 2 tablespoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* ½ teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ cup cornmeal
* 1 (4-pound) beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1½-inch cubes
* 8 ounces (about 8 slices) bacon, cut into ¼-inch pieces
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 2 small yellow onions, cut into 1-inch chunks
* 5 garlic cloves, chopped
* 3 jalapeño chiles, cored, seeded and finely diced
* 4 cups (32 oz) low-sodium beef broth
* 2 cups water, plus more for the chili paste and deglazing
* 1¼ cups lager beer
* 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon molasses
* 2 teaspoons natural unsweetened cocoa powder
* Fresh cilantro, shredded cheese, and lime wedges for garnish

**Instructions**

1. Combine the ancho chile, chipotle chile, cumin, oregano, coriander, cinnamon, and cornmeal in a small bowl. Add a bit of water to form a paste and set aside.
2. Fry the bacon in a large Dutch oven until the fat has rendered and the bacon is crisp. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon. Pour all but a few teaspoons of the bacon fat into a small bowl and reserve.
3. Season the beef with salt. Working in batches (single layer), sear the meat until well browned on at least one side, adding reserved bacon fat as needed. Transfer seared beef to a plate.
4. Add a splash of water to the pot — it will smoke — and scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon to deglaze. Pour the liquid over the beef.
5. Reduce heat to medium. Add 3 tablespoons reserved bacon fat to the pot. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeños and cook 2 minutes more.
6. Add the reserved chili paste and sauté until fragrant, a few minutes.
7. Add the beef broth and whisk until the spices are dissolved. Add water, beer, crushed tomatoes, molasses, cocoa powder, seared beef, and cooked bacon.
8. Bring to a simmer, then cover with the lid slightly ajar. Cook for 2½ to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender and the sauce is nicely thickened.
9. Ladle into bowls and serve with shredded cheese, cilantro, and lime wedges.

**Notes**

Look for chuck roast with good marbling — avoid lean pre-packaged "stew meat." Trim only large flaps of fat. Can be made up to 3 days ahead or frozen for up to 3 months. Great for leftovers as tacos, burritos, or over rice.
