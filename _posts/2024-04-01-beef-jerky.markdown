Real tasty beef jerky.

**Tools**

1. Pellet smoker or dehydrater

**Ingredients**

* 2lb beef round steak, cut into 1/8" strips
* 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tablespoons liquid smoke (skip if using smoker)
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon meat tenderizer
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon ground paprika

**Instructions**

1. Put beef in freezer for 90 minutes to make it easier to cut.
2. Trim fat from the beef
3. Cut beef into 1/8" strips
4. Prepare the marinade by combining all other ingredients. Whisk until mixed well.
5. Put beef strips in a glass dish or bowl. Pour marinade over top. Toss until evenly coated.
6. Cover and marinate for 8 hours or overnight
7. Remove from fridge
8. If there are any pieces thicker than 1/8", put in between plastic wrap and pound meat to 1/8" thickness.
9. Arrange in single layer on dehydrator racks, or on stainless steel racks if going in smoker.
10. Dehydrate or smoke at 165 degrees. Check after 3 hours.

**Notes**

* I tripled this recipe last time since I had 6 lbs of steak. Might as well make a lot since it goes fast!

* If you are dehydrating on the smoker, omit the Liquid Smoke, or use less.
