Marinated chicken thighs with a creamy, spicy green sauce — big Peruvian flavors with minimal effort. Marinate overnight for best results.

**Ingredients**

*Chicken:*

* 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled
* ⅓ cup soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons lime juice
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* ½ teaspoon dried oregano
* Black pepper to taste

*Green Sauce (Aji Verde):*

* 3 jalapeños, seeded, ribs removed, roughly chopped
* 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
* 2 green onions, chopped (green parts only)
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled
* ½ cup mayonnaise
* ¼ cup Greek yogurt
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

**Instructions**

1. Puree garlic, soy sauce, lime juice, oil, cumin, paprika, oregano, and a pinch of black pepper in a blender.
2. Place chicken in a large ziploc bag, add marinade, and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours.
3. For the green sauce, combine all ingredients except olive oil in a blender and process until smooth. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve.
4. Preheat grill to medium-high heat (around 350°F). Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Place on oiled grill grates.
5. Cook for 5-6 minutes per side with the grill cover closed, until internal temperature reaches 165°F.
6. Let rest a few minutes, then serve with the green sauce.

**Notes**

Can also roast at 500°F for about 30 minutes (tent with foil after 15), or air fry at 360°F for 12-15 minutes flipping halfway. Sub Greek yogurt or sour cream for the mayo if you prefer. Use serrano peppers instead of jalapeños for more heat.
