Creamy butternut squash soup with Granny Smith apple and nutmeg — all the flavors of fall. Pair with crusty bread and a salad for an easy dinner.

**Ingredients**

* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 large leeks (white and pale green parts only), chopped
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 large potato, peeled and cubed
* 2 cups cubed butternut squash
* 1 cup diced carrots
* 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and sliced 1/4-inch thick
* 1 quart chicken stock
* 1/4 cup dry white wine (optional)
* 1/2 cup light cream
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 tablespoons chopped chives

**Instructions**

1. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in leeks and onions; cook and stir until onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Add potato, squash, carrots, apple, and chicken stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes.
3. Carefully purée soup in batches in a blender, or use a stick blender to purée soup in the pot.
4. Return puréed soup to the pot and stir in wine and cream. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper; simmer gently for 5 minutes.
5. Ladle into bowls and garnish with chopped chives.
