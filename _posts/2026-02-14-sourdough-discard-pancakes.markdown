Fluffy pancakes made with sourdough discard (or fresh starter). From America's Test Kitchen's Quarantiny Starter Project. Makes 16 four-inch pancakes, serves 4-6.

**Ingredients**

* 1½ cups (212g) all-purpose flour
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 2 large eggs
* ¼ cup plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
* 1 cup (285g) 100% hydration sourdough discard
* 1 cup milk
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions**

1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
2. Whisk eggs and ¼ cup oil in a second bowl until well combined. Whisk in sourdough discard, milk, and vanilla.
3. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir gently until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Let batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking.
4. Heat ½ teaspoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering. Wipe out oil with paper towels, leaving a thin film. Drop 1 tablespoon batter in center — if it's pale golden brown after 1 minute, skillet is ready.
5. Using a ¼-cup measure, portion batter into skillet in 3 places, leaving 2 inches between portions. Spread gently into 4-inch rounds if needed.
6. Cook until edges are set, first sides are golden brown, and bubbles on surface begin to break, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until second sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer.
7. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining oil as necessary. Serve immediately.

**Notes**

Can be made with freshly-proofed sourdough starter in place of discard. Works on an electric griddle set to 350°F. Finished pancakes can be held in a 200°F oven on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet.
