From America's Test Kitchen. Makes 16 4-inch pancakes, serves 4–6. Can use freshly-proofed starter in place of discard.

**Ingredients**

* 1½ cups (212g) all-purpose flour
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 2 large eggs
* ¼ cup plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
* 1 cup (285g) 100% hydration sourdough discard
* 1 cup milk
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions**

1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
2. Whisk eggs and ¼ cup oil in a medium bowl. Whisk in sourdough discard, milk, and vanilla.
3. Add wet mixture to dry mixture and stir gently until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Let batter sit 10 minutes before cooking.
4. Heat ½ tsp oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low until shimmering. Wipe out with paper towels, leaving thin film. Drop 1 tbsp batter in center — should be pale golden brown after 1 minute. Adjust heat as needed.
5. Using ¼-cup measure, portion batter into skillet in 3 places (2 inches apart). Spread gently into 4-inch rounds if needed. Cook until edges set, bottoms golden, and bubbles just breaking on surface, 2–3 minutes. Flip, cook until second side golden, 1–2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

**Notes**

* Can cook on an electric griddle set to 350°F.
* Hold finished pancakes in a 200°F oven on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet.
