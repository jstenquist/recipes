Serves 2-4

## Ingredients

- 4-6 bone-in chicken thighs and/or drumsticks
- Salt only (no pepper yet)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 small shallot or onion, finely sliced or diced
- 2 cloves garlic, smashed
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed (for finishing)
- 1 teaspoon fresh oregano, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
- Freshly cracked black pepper, to finish

## Instructions

1. **Season and dry:** Pat chicken completely dry and season generously with salt only, reserving pepper for later to prevent burning.

2. **Render and brown:** Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place chicken skin-side down and let it brown deeply for 8-10 minutes without moving. Flip and cook another 3-4 minutes. Remove to a plate.

3. **Build umami base:** Lower heat. Add butter, shallot, and garlic, cooking until soft. Stir in tomato paste and cook 1-2 minutes until darkened.

4. **Deglaze and braise:** Add soy sauce, Worcestershire, and chicken stock. Scrape pan to release browned bits.

5. **Gentle braise:** Return chicken to pan. Cover loosely and simmer gently for 20-30 minutes until tender but intact. Maintain a "lazy bubble" simmer—do not boil. Alternatively, cover and place the entire pan in a 300°F oven.

6. **Mount sauce:** Remove chicken from pan. Turn off heat. Whisk in cold butter cubes one at a time until glossy and velvety.

7. **Finish:** Spoon sauce over chicken. Top with fresh oregano, parsley, and freshly cracked black pepper.

## Notes

"Mounting a sauce" means whisking cold butter into a warm sauce off the heat. This creates an emulsion, softens sharp flavors, and adds body without heaviness.
