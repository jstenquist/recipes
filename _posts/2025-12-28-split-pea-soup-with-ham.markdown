## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 2 cups chopped onion
- 1 cup diced carrot (1/4-inch dice)
- 1 cup diced celery (1/4-inch dice)
- 1/4 to 1 teaspoon kosher salt, to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper, plus more to taste
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound dried green split peas, rinsed and sorted
- 1 meaty ham bone
- 1 large bay leaf (or 2 small)
- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, chopped and divided
- 6 cups low-sodium chicken stock
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup diced ham (1/4-inch dice)
- Croutons, for serving

## Instructions

1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat until foaming subsides. Add onion, carrot, celery, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook until vegetables are softened, 5-8 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute, until aromatic. Stir in split peas.

2. Add ham bone, bay leaf, and 1 teaspoon fresh thyme. Stir in chicken stock and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 60-90 minutes, stirring occasionally, until split peas are cooked down and soup is thickened to desired consistency. Stir more frequently as the soup thickens; add more stock or water if it gets too thick.

3. Add diced ham during the last 15 minutes of cooking. When ready to serve, remove and discard ham bone and bay leaf, stir in remaining 1 teaspoon fresh thyme. Season to taste with salt. Serve hot with croutons and cracked black pepper.

## Notes

- Salt varies significantly across ham brands. Season to taste after simmering. If ham is particularly salty, omit the 1/4 teaspoon salt when sweating vegetables.
- **Ham Bone Substitution:** Two smoked ham hocks (1-1/2 lbs) can be substituted. They're saltier, so reduce salt accordingly. Shred meat off bones before serving.
- **Make-ahead:** Store refrigerated for 3 days or frozen 2-3 months. Add stock to thin when reheating.
