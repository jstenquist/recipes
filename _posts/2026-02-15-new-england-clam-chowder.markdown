Rich, creamy New England clam chowder — a classic. Pair with oyster crackers and crusty bread.

**Ingredients**

* 4 slices bacon, diced
* 1 1/2 cups chopped onion
* 4 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
* 1 1/2 cups water
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 3 cups half-and-half
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 (10 ounce) cans minced clams

**Instructions**

1. Place diced bacon in a large stockpot over medium-high heat; cook and stir until almost crisp. Add onion; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in potatoes and add water; season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
3. Pour in half-and-half and add butter.
4. Drain clams, reserving clam liquid; stir clams and half of the clam liquid into the soup. Cook until heated through, without boiling, about 5 minutes.
5. Serve and enjoy!
